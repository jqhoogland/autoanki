 - a neural network similar to an LSTM but with a 3D hidden state and convolutional operations. 


 is a cryptographic hashing algorithm that produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. It is used to verify the integrity of data by computing a checksum value, which is then encoded using Base64.
 variant was almost always the best in terms both of data efﬁciency and asymptotic performance.

. Encoder network is a multilayer CNN with domain-specific parameters. DRC: all ConvLSTM modules use one convolution with 128 output channels, a kernel size of 3 and stride of 1. All cell states and hidden states have 32 channels. 1D LSTM: all LSTM modules have hidden size 200. Policy: single hidden layer MLP with 256 units. 


. It is fed encoded observations from Sokoban and is passed through a fully connected layer before the tree planning and backup steps.
